This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the ClearML Enterprise Server (control-plane) in a Kubernetes cluster.

The ClearML Enterprise Server includes the ClearML `apiserver`, `fileserver`, and `webserver` components. 
The package also includes MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and Redis as Helm dependencies.

:::warning Upgrading from chart versions 10.11.6 and below
Starting in chart version `10.11.7`, ClearML is transitioning to a new mongodb chart source (mckMongodb).

To upgrade an existing installation follow the [MongoDB chart Migration Guide](k8s_mckmongo_migration.md) to ensure data consistency and compatibility with future chart versions.
:::

## Prerequisites

To deploy a ClearML Server, ensure the following components and configurations are in place:

- Kubernetes Cluster: A standard Kubernetes cluster is recommended for optimal GPU support.
- CLI Tools: `kubectl` and `helm` must be installed and configured.
- Ingress Controller: An Ingress controller (e.g., `nginx-ingress`) is required. If exposing services externally, configure 
  a LoadBalancer-capable solution (e.g. `MetalLB`).
- Server and workers that communicate on HTTP/S (ports 80 and 443). Additionally, the TCP session feature requires a 
  range of ports for TCP traffic based on your configuration (see [AI App Gateway installation](appgw_install_k8s.md)).
- DNS Configuration: A domain with subdomain support is required, ideally with trusted TLS certificates. All entries must 
  be resolvable by the Ingress controller. Example subdomains:
  - Server:
    - `api.<BASE_DOMAIN>`
    - `app.<BASE_DOMAIN>`
    - `files.<BASE_DOMAIN>`
  - Worker:
    - `router.<BASE_DOMAIN>`
    - `tcp-router.<BASE_DOMAIN>` (optional, for TCP sessions)
- Storage: A configured StorageClass and an accessible storage backend.
- A DockerHub token to access the OCI enterprise Helm charts and Docker images (`<CLEARML_DOCKERHUB_TOKEN>`)

### Recommended Cluster Specifications

For optimal performance, a Kubernetes cluster with at least 3 nodes is recommended, each provisioned with:

- 8 vCPUs
- 32 GB RAM
- 500 GB storage

## Installation

### Log into the ClearML OCI Registry

Login to the ClearML OCI registry:

```bash
helm registry login docker.io --username allegroaienterprise --password <CLEARML_DOCKERHUB_TOKEN>
```

### Prepare Values

Create a `clearml-values.override.yaml` file with the following content:

:::note
In the following configuration, replace the `<BASE_DOMAIN>` placeholders with a valid domain that will have records 
pointing to the cluster's Ingress Controller. This will be the base domain for reaching your ClearML installation.
:::

```yaml
imageCredentials:
  password: "<CLEARML_DOCKERHUB_TOKEN>"
clearml:
  cookieDomain: "<BASE_DOMAIN>"
apiserver:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hostName: "api.<BASE_DOMAIN>"
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
fileserver:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hostName: "files.<BASE_DOMAIN>"
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
webserver:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hostName: "app.<BASE_DOMAIN>"
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
clearmlApplications:
  enabled: true
```

:::important Special Clean installation overrides
Add the following settings in your `clearml-values.override.yaml` file to use the new (10.11.7) bundled MongoDB dependency (mckMongodb) instead of the legacy MongoDB chart:

```yaml
mongodb:
  enabled: false
mckMongodb:
  enabled: true
  migrated: true
```
:::

### Install the Chart

Install the ClearML Enterprise Helm chart using the previous values override file.

```bash
helm upgrade -i -n clearml clearml-enterprise oci://docker.io/clearml/clearml-enterprise --create-namespace -f clearml-values.override.yaml 
```

## Additional Configuration Options

:::note
You can view the full set of available and documented values of the chart by running the following command:

```bash
helm show readme oci://docker.io/clearml/clearml-enterprise
# or
helm show values oci://docker.io/clearml/clearml-enterprise
```
:::

### Default Secret Values

For improved security, all the internal credentials are auto-generated randomly and stored in a Secret in 
Kubernetes.

If you need to define your own credentials to be used instead, replace the default key and secret values in `clearml-values.override.yaml`.

```yaml
clearml:
  # Replace the following values to use custom internal credentials.
  apiserverKey: ""
  apiserverSecret: ""
  fileserverKey: ""
  fileserverSecret: ""
  secureAuthTokenSecret: ""
  testUserKey: ""
  testUserSecret: ""
```

In a shell, if `openssl` is installed, you can use this simple command to generate random strings suitable as keys and secrets:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 16
```

### Fixed Users

Enable and configure simple login with username and password in `clearml-values.override.yaml`. This is useful for simple PoC 
installations. This is an optional step in case the SSO (Identity provider) configuration is not performed.

Please note that this setup is not ideal for multi-tenant setups as fixed users will only be associated with the default tenant.

```yaml
apiserver:
  additionalConfigs:
    apiserver.conf: |
      auth {
        fixed_users {
          enabled: true
          pass_hashed: false
          users: [
            {
              username: "my_user"
              password: "my_password"
              name: "My User"
              admin: true
            },
          ]
        }
      }
```


### Internal Database Authentication

:::important  
Internal Database Authentication is supported starting from `clearml-enterprise` Helm chart version `10.9.0`. 
:::

By default, the ClearML Enterprise Helm chart deploys its internal DB components (MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and Redis) 
through dependent charts configured for open authentication. You can enable authentication for these internal databases 
to improve security. 

This following procedure applies specifically to dependency databases deployed as part of the `clearml-enterprise` Helm 
chart (see [here](#using-external-databases-with-clearml) for additional database configuration options).

To enable authentication, update the control-plane `clearml-values.override.yaml` file.

For example, the following configuration:

* Enables username/password authentication on all bundled databases  
* Ensures ClearML services use the configured credentials automatically

```yaml
# Enable Redis Auth
redis:
  auth:
    enabled: true
    password: "MyStrongPassword123"
# Enable MongoDB Auth
mongodb:
  enabled: true
  auth:
    enabled: true
    rootUser: root
    rootPassword: "MyStrongPassword123"
# Enable ElasticSearch Auth
elasticsearch:
  extraEnvs:
    - name: bootstrap.memory_lock
      value: "false"
    - name: cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries
      value: "500"
    - name: cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low
      value: "500mb"
    - name: cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high
      value: "500mb"
    - name: cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage
      value: "500mb"
    - name: http.compression_level
      value: "7"
    - name: reindex.remote.whitelist
      value: '"*.*"'
  esConfig: {}
  secret:
    enabled: true
    password: "MyStrongPassword123"
```

### Using External Databases with ClearML

The ClearML Enterprise Server can be configured to use external services for the ElasticSearch, MongoDB, and Redis databases, 
instead of those included in the server bundle. Note that if you use external database instances, ClearML will not manage 
the database's lifecycle or version. For MongoDB specifically, ClearML disables internal version checks (`CLEARML__apiserver__mongo__ensure_db_version_on_startup=false`).

As a result, you are fully responsible for:

* Provisioning and maintaining the database instance
* Applying security updates and version upgrades
* Ensuring availability, backups, and disaster recovery

Before upgrading ClearML, always consult the ClearML release notes and documentation to verify which DB versions 
are supported. Running unsupported versions may cause ClearML to fail or behave unexpectedly.

To connect external databases, configure the `externalServices` section in the `clearml-values.override.yaml` file:

```
externalServices:
  # Existing ElasticSearch connectionstring if elasticsearch.enabled is false
  elasticsearchConnectionString: "[{\"host\":\"es_hostname1\",\"port\":9200},{\"host\":\"es_hostname2\",\"port\":9200},{\"host\":\"es_hostname3\",\"port\":9200}]"
  # Existing MongoDB connection string for BACKEND to use if mongodb.enabled is false
  mongodbConnectionStringAuth: "mongodb://mongodb_hostname:27017/auth"
  # Existing MongoDB connection string for AUTH to use if mongodb.enabled is false
  mongodbConnectionStringBackend: "mongodb://mongodb_hostnamehostname:27017/backend"
  # Existing Redis Hostname to use if redis.enabled is false
  redisHost: "redis_hostname"
  # Existing Redis Port to use if redis.enabled is false
  redisPort: 6379
```

## Monitoring

Monitoring your ClearML deployment is recommended to ensure service availability and detect performance or resource 
issues early. For monitoring guidelines and recommended metrics, see [Monitoring](extra_configs/monitoring_k8s.md).

## Next Steps

After installing the ClearML Enterprise Server, you can enhance your deployment by enabling optional services that 
extend ClearML's capabilities for scheduling, interactivity, authentication, and more.

### Applications Installation
ClearML Applications are plugins that extend the functionality of the ClearML Enterprise Server. They enable users 
to manage ML workloads and automate recurring workflows--no code required

Applications are installed on top of the ClearML Server and are provided by the ClearML team.

For more information, see the [Application Installation guide](apps_k8s.md).

### ClearML Enterprise Agent

The ClearML Enterprise Agent enables scheduling and execution of distributed workloads (Tasks) on your Kubernetes cluster.

See the [ClearML Agent installation guide](../../clearml_agent/clearml_agent_deployment_k8s.md#agent-with-an-enterprise-server).

### AI Application Gateway

The AI App Gateway enables secure, authenticated access to ClearML application endpoints such as model serving or IDE workloads
based on ClearML user permissions. It routes HTTPS traffic from users to running pods on the cluster.

See the [AI Application Gateway installation guide](appgw_install_k8s.md).

## Advanced Options
### GPU Operator

Deploy the NVIDIA GPU Operator in order to use Nvidia GPUs in ClearML.

See the [GPU Operator Basic Deployment guide](../../clearml_agent/fractional_gpus/gpu_operator.md).

### Fractional GPU Support

Available GPU fractioning methods:

* ClearML Dynamic MIG Orchestrator (CDMO): Manage GPU fractions using NVIDIA MIGs. See the [CDMO guide](../../clearml_agent/fractional_gpus/cdmo.md)
* ClearML Fractional GPU Injector (CFGI): Use fractional (non-MIG) GPU slices for efficient resource sharing. See the [CFGI guide](../../clearml_agent/fractional_gpus/cfgi.md)
* Mixed Deployments: Deploy both CDMO and CFGI in clusters with diverse GPU types. Use the NVIDIA GPU Operator to handle 
  mixed hardware setups. See the [CDMO and CFGI guide](../../clearml_agent/fractional_gpus/cdmo_cfgi_same_cluster.md).

### Multi-Tenant Setup

Run multiple isolated tenants on a single ClearML Server deployment, each with its own configuration and user namespaces.

See the [Multi-Tenant Service guide](multi_tenant_k8s.md).

### SSO (Identity Provider) Setup

Integrate identity providers to enable SSO login for ClearML Enterprise users.

See the [SSO Setup guide](../../user_management/identity_providers.md).

### ClearML Custom Event Monitoring

ClearML Enterprise supports sending custom events to selected Kafka topics. 

See the [Custom Event guide](extra_configs/custom_billing.md).

### ClearML Presign Service

The ClearML Presign Service securely generates pre-signed storage URLs for authenticated users.

See the [ClearML Presign Service guide](extra_configs/presign_service.md).

### Install with a Non-Root User

In some Helm charts, you will find a values file called `values-enterprise-non-root-privileged.yaml` to be used for a 
non-root installation.

These values are for Enterprise versions only, and they need to be adapted to specific infrastructure needs. The 
`containerSecurityContext` is related to the Kubernetes distribution used/configuration and will need to be customized accordingly.
