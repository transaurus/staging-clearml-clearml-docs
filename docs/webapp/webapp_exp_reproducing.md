title: Reproducing Task Runs
---

You can reproduce task runs on local or remote machines in one of the following ways:
* Cloning any task - Make an exact copy, while maintaining the original task
* Resetting a task whose status is not *Published* - Delete the previous run's logs and output

After cloning or resetting, enqueue the reset or newly cloned task for execution by a worker.

Tasks can also be modified before execution. See [Tuning Tasks](webapp_exp_tuning.md).

## Cloning
To clone a task:
1. In the task table, right-click the task to reproduce and click **Clone**.
1. In the `Clone Task` modal, set the following:
   * Project - The project where the task will be saved
   * Name - The name for the new task. 
   
     :::note New task name template
     By default, the new task is named `Clone of <original_task_name>`.
     
     This default name can be customized:
     - In **ClearML Enterprise**, via UI **Settings** page **>** [**Task clone name template**](settings/webapp_settings_ui_customization.md#task-clone-name-template)
     - In **ClearML Open Source**, via server configuration setting. For more information, see [Default Task Clone Name](../deploying_clearml/clearml_server_config.md#default-task-clone-name).
     ::: 
   
   * Set `<cloned_task>` as parent - Select to set this task as the new task's parent
   * Clear Dataviews (Enterprise feature) - If selected, the new task will start with no Dataviews 
   * Force Original Packages - If selected, use the parent task's `original pip`/`original conda` for the new task’s [`Python Packages`](webapp_exp_track_visual.md#python-packages).
   * Description (optional)
1. Click **Clone**

:::note
By default, the new task's parent task is set to the original task's parent, unless the original task does not 
have a parent, in which case the original task is set as the parent. Select `Set <cloned_task> as parent` to force 
the original task to become the clone's parent.

## Resetting

To reset a task:
1. In the task table, right-click the relevant task and click **Reset**. 
1. In the `Reset Task` modal, if you want the task's artifacts and debug samples to be deleted from the 
   ClearML file server, click the checkbox
1. Click **Reset**

## Final Steps 

At the end of the process you are left with a `Draft` task, meaning that it is editable.

Re-execute the new task:
1. If desired, modify the task's configuration (see [Tuning Tasks](webapp_exp_tuning.md)).
1. Enqueue the task for execution. Right-click the task > Enqueue > Select a queue > **ENQUEUE**.
	
   :::note
   Make sure that a [ClearML Agent](../clearml_agent.md) has been assigned to the selected queue 
   :::

A ClearML Agent will fetch the task from the queue and execute it. The task can now be tracked and its 
results visualized.
