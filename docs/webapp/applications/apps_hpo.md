title: Hyperparameter Optimization
---

:::info Pro Plan Offering
The ClearML HPO App is available under the ClearML Pro plan.
:::

The Hyperparameter Optimization Application finds the set of parameter values that optimize a specific metric(s) for your 
model.

It takes in a ClearML task and its parameters to optimize. The parameter search space can be specified
by specific (discrete) values and/or value ranges (uniform parameters). 

The optimization app launches multiple copies of the original task, each time sampling different parameter sets, 
applying a user-selected optimization strategy (random search, Bayesian, etc.). 

Control the optimization process with the advanced configuration options, which include time, iteration, and task 
limits.

Once you have launched an app instance, you can view the following information in its dashboard:

* Optimization Metric - Last reported and maximum / minimum values of objective metric over time
* Optimization Objective - Objective metric values per task
* Parallel coordinates - A visualization of parameter value impact on optimization objective
* Summary - Task summary table: task execution information, objective metric and parameter values.
* Budget - Available iterations and tasks budget (percentage, out of the values defined in the HPO instance's advanced configuration)
* Resources - Number of workers servicing the HPO execution queue, and the number of currently running optimization tasks

:::tip EMBEDDING CLEARML VISUALIZATION
You can embed plots from the app instance dashboard into [ClearML Reports](../webapp_reports.md). The Enterprise Plan and 
Hosted Service also support embedding resources in third-party platforms that support embedded content (e.g. Notion). These visualizations 
are updated live as the app instance(s) updates. Hover over the plot and click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-plotly-embed-code.svg" alt="Embed code" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to copy the embed code, and navigate to a report to paste the embed code.

## HPO Instance Configuration

When configuring a new HPO instance, you can fill in the required parameters or reuse the configuration of 
a previously launched instance.  

Launch an app instance with the configuration of a previously launched instance using one of the following options:
* Cloning a previously launched app instance will open the instance launch form with the original instance's 
configuration prefilled.
* Importing an app configuration file. You can export the configuration of a previously launched instance as a JSON file 
when viewing its configuration.

The prefilled instance launch form can be edited before starting the new app instance. 

To configure a new app instance, click `Launch New` <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-add.svg" alt="Add new" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to open the app's instance launch form.

### Configuration Options 

:::note
Administrators can [customize](../../deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/app_launch_form_custom.md) the launch form and 
modify field names and/or available options and defaults. 

This section describes the default configuration provided by ClearML.
:::

* **Import Configuration** - Import an app instance configuration file. This will fill the instance launch form with the 
  values from the file, which can be modified before launching the app instance
* **Initial Task to Optimize** - ID of a ClearML task to optimize. This task will be cloned, and each clone will 
  sample a different set of hyperparameters values
* **Optimization Method** - The optimization strategy to employ (e.g. random, grid, Hyperband)
* **Objectives** - Set the optimization targets of minimizing or maximizing the values of a specified metric(s)
    * Optimization Objective Metric's Title - Title of metric to optimize
    * Optimization Objective Metric's Series - Metric series (variant) to optimize
    * Optimization Objective Trend - Choose the optimization target, whether to maximize or minimize the value of the 
      metric specified above
    * \+ Add item - Add an objective
* **Execution Queue** - The [ClearML Queue](../../fundamentals/agents_and_queues.md#what-is-a-queue) to which 
  optimization tasks will be enqueued (make sure an agent is assigned to that queue)
* **Parameters to Optimize** - Parameters comprising the optimization space
    * Type 
        * Uniform Parameters - A value range to sample
            * Minimum Value
            * Maximum Value
            * Step Size - Step size between samples
        * Discrete Parameters - A set of values to sample
            * Values - Comma separated list of values to sample
    * Name - The original task's configuration parameter name (including section name e.g. `Args/lr`)  <br/><br/>
    :::tip Hydra Parameters
    For tasks using Hydra, input parameters from the OmegaConf in the following format:
    `Hydra/<param>`. Specify `<param>` using dot notation. For example, if your OmegaConf looks like this: 
    ```
    dataset:
      user: root
      main:
        number: 80
    ```
    Specify the `number` parameter with `Hydra/dataset.main.number`.

    Additionally, make sure that the initial task's `_allow_omegaconf_edit_` parameter is set to `False` (in task's 
    **CONFIGURATION > HYPERPARAMETERS > Hydra**).
    :::
* **Optimization Job Title** (optional) - Name for the HPO instance. This will appear in the instance list 
* **Optimization Tasks Destination Project** (optional) - The project where optimization tasks will be saved. 
  Leave empty to use the same project as the Initial task. 
* **Maximum Concurrent Tasks** - The maximum number of simultaneously running optimization tasks
* **Advanced Configuration** (optional)
    * Limit Total HPO Tasks - Maximum total number of optimization tasks
    * Number of Top Tasks to Save - Number of best performing tasks to save (the rest are archived)
    * Limit Single Task Running Time (Minutes) - Time limit per optimization task. Tasks will be 
      stopped after the specified time elapsed
    * Minimal Number of Iterations Per Single Task - Some search methods, such as Optuna, prune underperforming 
      tasks. This is the minimum number of iterations per task before it can be stopped. Iterations are 
      based on the tasks' own reporting (for example, if tasks report every epoch, then iterations=epochs)
    * Maximum Number of Iterations Per Single Task - Maximum iterations per task after which it will be 
      stopped. Iterations are based on the tasks' own reporting (for example, if tasks report every epoch, 
      then iterations=epochs)
    * Limit Total Optimization Instance Time (Minutes) - Time limit for the whole optimization process (in minutes)
* **Export Configuration** - Export the app instance configuration as a JSON file, which you can later import to create 
  a new instance with the same configuration
