title: NVIDIA NIM
---

:::important Enterprise Feature
The NIM App is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

The NIM application enables users to launch [NVIDIA NIM](https://developer.nvidia.com/nim) models through their specific containers. The NIM application 
serves your model on a machine of your choice. Once an app instance is running, it serves your model through a secure, 
publicly accessible network endpoint. The app monitors endpoint activity and shuts down if the model remains inactive 
for a specified maximum idle time.

* The `NGC_API_KEY` environment variable needs to be set to a valid NGC API key. You can set the variable in one of the following ways:
  * The NIM app launch form's `Environment Variables` field
  * [Configuration vault](../settings/webapp_settings_profile.md#configuration-vault)

:::info AI Application Gateway
The NIM app makes use of the App Gateway Router which implements a secure, authenticated network endpoint for the model.

If the ClearML AI Application Gateway is not available, the model endpoint might not be accessible.
For more information, see [AI Application Gateway](../../deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/appgw.md).
:::

Once you start a NIM instance, you can view the following information in its dashboard:
* Status indicator
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-nvidia-active.svg" alt="Active instance" className="icon size-lg space-sm" /> - App instance is running and is actively in use
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-nvidia-loading.svg" alt="Loading instance" className="icon size-lg space-sm" /> - App instance is setting up
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-nvidia-idle.svg" alt="Idle instance" className="icon size-lg space-sm" /> - App instance is idle
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-nvidia-stopped.svg" alt="Stopped instance" className="icon size-lg space-sm" /> - App instance is stopped
* Idle time - Time elapsed since last activity 
* Endpoint - The publicly accessible URL of the model endpoint. Active model endpoints are also available in the 
  [Model Endpoints](../webapp_model_endpoints.md) table, which allows you to view and compare endpoint details and 
  monitor status over time
* Generate Token - Link to `AI APPLICATION GATEWAY` section of the Settings page, where you can generate a token for accessing your deployed model
* Command to connect to the deployed model. The generated `curl` command includes the model's endpoint. Replace `YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN` with a valid token generated in the `AI APPLICATION GATEWAY` section of the Settings page.
* Total Number of Requests - Number of requests over time
* Tokens per Second - Number of tokens processed over time
* Latency - Request response time (ms) over time
* Endpoint resource monitoring metrics over time
* CPU usage
  * Network throughput
  * Disk performance
  * Memory performance
  * GPU utilization
  * GPU memory usage
  * GPU temperature
* Console log - The console log shows the app instance's console output: setup progress, status changes, error messages,
etc.

:::tip EMBEDDING CLEARML VISUALIZATION
You can embed plots from the app instance dashboard into [ClearML Reports](../webapp_reports.md) and other third-party platforms that support embedded content
(e.g. Notion). These visualizations are updated live as the app instance(s) updates. Hover over the plot and click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-plotly-embed-code.svg" alt="Embed code" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to copy the embed code, and navigate to a report to paste the embed code.

## NIM Instance Configuration

When configuring a new NIM instance, you can fill in the required parameters or reuse the 
configuration of a previously launched instance. 

Launch an app instance with the configuration of a previously launched instance using one of the following options:
* Cloning a previously launched app instance will open the instance launch form with the original instance's 
configuration prefilled.
* Importing an app configuration file. You can export the configuration of a previously launched instance as a JSON file 
when viewing its configuration.

The prefilled configuration form can be edited before launching the new app instance.

To configure a new app instance, click `Launch New` <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-add.svg" alt="Add new" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to open the app's configuration form.

### Configuration Options

:::note
Administrators can [customize](../../deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/app_launch_form_custom.md) the launch form and 
modify field names and/or available options and defaults. 

This section describes the default configuration provided by ClearML.
:::

* **Import Configuration**: Import an app instance configuration file. This will fill the instance launch form with the 
values from the file, which can be modified before launching the app instance
* **Application instance project**: The ClearML project where the app instance is created. Access is determined by 
  project-level permissions (i.e. users with read access can use the app).
* **NIM Container Image**: Select the containerized application image to use. Note the different tags / versions of each image
* **Compute Resource (Queue)**: The [ClearML Queue](../../fundamentals/agents_and_queues.md#what-is-a-queue) to which the NIM app instance task will be enqueued. <br/><br/>
  :::info Agent requirements
  Make sure the agent assigned to this queue:
  * Has access to NVIDIA's container registry (`nvcr.io`). See [NVCR Access](../../clearml_agent/clearml_agent_nvcr.md) for more information.
  * Runs in [Docker mode](../../clearml_agent/clearml_agent_execution_env.md#docker-mode) if it is a bare-metal agent
  :::
* **AI Gateway Route**: Select an available, admin-preconfigured route to use as the service endpoint. If none is selected, an ephemeral endpoint will be created.
* **Idle Time Limit** (Hours): Maximum idle time after which the app instance will shut down
* **Environment Variables**: Additional environment variable to set inside the container before launching the application 
* **Application Session Tags**: Comma separated list of tags to add to your current application session 
* **Export Configuration** - Export the app instance configuration as a JSON file, which you can later import to create a 
new instance with the same configuration
