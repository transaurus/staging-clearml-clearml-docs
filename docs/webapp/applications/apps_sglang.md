title: SGLang Model Deployment
---

:::important Enterprise Feature
The SGLang Model Deployment App is available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

The SGLang Model Deployment application enables users to create secure, authenticated LLM endpoints using the SGLang 
serving engine. This application supports various model configurations and customizations to optimize performance and 
resource usage. The SGLang Model Deployment application serves your model on a machine of your choice. Once an app 
instance is running, it serves your model through a secure, publicly accessible network endpoint. 

The app supports multi-model hosting and Universal Memory technology, enabling inactive models to be offloaded to other memory options to free GPU resources:
* CPU RAM – via `Automatic CPU Offloading`, `CPU Offload GiB`, and configurable `Max CUDA Memory` limits.
* Disk storage – via `Disk Swapping` (when `Automatic CPU Offloading` is disabled).

The app monitors endpoint activity and shuts down if the model remains inactive for a specified maximum idle time.

:::info AI Application Gateway
The SGLang Model Deployment app makes use of the App Gateway Router which implements a secure, authenticated 
network endpoint for the model.

If the ClearML AI Application Gateway is not available, the model endpoint might not be accessible.
For more information, see [AI Application Gateway](../../deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/appgw.md).
:::

Once you start a SGLang Model Deployment instance, you can view the following information in its dashboard:
* Status indicator
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-sglang-active.svg" alt="Active instance" className="icon size-lg space-sm" /> - App instance is running and is actively in use
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-sglang-loading.svg" alt="Loading instance" className="icon size-lg space-sm" /> - App instance is setting up
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-sglang-idle.svg" alt="Idle instance" className="icon size-lg space-sm" /> - App instance is idle
  * <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-sglang-stopped.svg" alt="Stopped instance" className="icon size-lg space-sm" /> - App instance is stopped
* Idle time - Time elapsed since last activity 
* Generate Token - Link to `AI APPLICATION GATEWAY` section of the Settings page, where you can generate a token for accessing your deployed model
* Deployed models table:
  * Model name
  * Endpoint - The publicly accessible URL of the model endpoint. Active model endpoints are also available in the 
    [Model Endpoints](../webapp_model_endpoints.md) table, which allows you to view and compare endpoint details and 
    monitor status over time
* Command to connect to the deployed model
  * Select model to generate a `curl` command for connecting to it
  * Prompt - Provide a prompt to send to the model. This will be added to the `curl` command
  * The generated `curl` command includes the model's endpoint and prompt. Replace `YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN` with a valid
  token generated in the `AI APPLICATION GATEWAY` section of the [Settings](../settings/webapp_settings_profile.md#ai-application-gateway-tokens) page.
* Total Number of Requests - Number of requests over time
* Tokens per Second - Number of tokens processed over time
* Latency - Request response time (ms) over time

:::tip EMBEDDING CLEARML VISUALIZATION
You can embed plots from the app instance dashboard into [ClearML Reports](../webapp_reports.md) and other third-party platforms that support embedded content
(e.g. Notion). These visualizations are updated live as the app instance(s) updates. Hover over the plot and click <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-plotly-embed-code.svg" alt="Embed code" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to copy the embed code, and navigate to a report to paste the embed code.

## SGLang Model Deployment Instance Configuration

When configuring a new SGLang Model Deployment instance, you can fill in the required parameters or reuse the 
configuration of a previously launched instance. 

Launch an app instance with the configuration of a previously launched instance using one of the following options:
* Cloning a previously launched app instance will open the instance launch form with the original instance's 
configuration prefilled.
* Importing an app configuration file. You can export the configuration of a previously launched instance as a JSON file 
when viewing its configuration.

The prefilled configuration form can be edited before launching the new app instance.

To configure a new app instance, click `Launch New` <img src="/docs/latest/icons/ico-add.svg" alt="Add new" className="icon size-md space-sm" /> 
to open the app's configuration form.

### Configuration Options

:::note
Administrators can [customize](../../deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/app_launch_form_custom.md) the launch form and 
modify field names and/or available options and defaults. 

This section describes the default configuration provided by ClearML.
:::

* **Import Configuration**: Import an app instance configuration file. This will fill the instance launch form with the 
values from the file, which can be modified before launching the app instance
* **Instance name**:  Name for the app instance. This will appear in the instance list
* **Service Project - Access Control** - The ClearML project where the app instance is created. Access is determined by 
  project-level permissions (i.e. users with read access can use the app).
* **Queue** - The [ClearML Queue](../../fundamentals/agents_and_queues.md#what-is-a-queue) to which the SGLang Model Deployment app 
instance task will be enqueued. Make sure an agent is assigned to that queue.

  :::tip Multi-GPU inference
  To run multi-GPU inference, ensure the queue's pod specification (from the base template and/or `templateOverrides`) defines multiple GPUs. See [GPU Queues with Shared Memory](../../clearml_agent/clearml_agent_custom_workload.md#example-gpu-queues-with-shared-memory)
  for an example configuration of a queue that allocates multiple GPUs and shared memory.
  :::

* **AI Gateway Route** - Select an available, admin-preconfigured route to use as the service endpoint. If none is selected, an ephemeral endpoint will be created.
* **Model** - A ClearML Model ID or a HuggingFace model name (e.g. `openai-community/gpt2`)
* **Model Configuration**: Configure the behavior and performance of the language model engine. This allows you to 
  customize model selection, parallelism policies, memory management, optimization techniques, and more. See more details 
  about [SGLang configuration options](https://docs.sglang.ai/advanced_features/server_arguments.html#model-and-tokenizer)
  (parameter names appear as their command-line form, e.g., "Max Running Requests" is listed as `--max-running-requests`).
