title: Task Dataviews
---

:::important ENTERPRISE FEATURE
Dataviews are available under the ClearML Enterprise plan.
:::

While a task is running, and any time after it finishes, results are tracked and can be visualized in the ClearML 
Enterprise WebApp (UI). 

In addition to all of ClearML's offerings, ClearML Enterprise keeps track of the Dataviews associated with a
task, which can be viewed and [modified](webapp_exp_modifying.md) in the WebApp.

## Viewing a Task's Dataviews 

In a task's page, go to the **DATAVIEWS** tab to view all the task's Dataview details, including:
* Input data [selection](#input) and [filtering](#filtering)
* ROI [mapping](#mapping) (label translation)
* [Label enumeration](#label-enumeration)
* [Iteration controls](#iteration-control)

### Input

SingleFrames are iterated from the Dataset versions specified in the **INPUT** area, in the **SELECTED DATAVIEW** drop-down 
menu.


### Filtering

The **FILTERING** section lists the SingleFrame filters iterated by a Dataview, applied to the task data. 

Each frame filter is composed of: 
* A Dataset version to input from 
* ROI Rules for SingleFrames to include and/or exclude certain criteria.
* Weights for debiasing input data. 
  
Combinations of frame filters can implement complex querying. 

For more detailed information, see [Filtering](../dataviews.md#filtering).

### Mapping

ROI label mapping (label translation) applies to the new model. For example, use ROI label mapping to accomplish the following: 

* Combine several labels under another more generic label.
* Consolidate disparate datasets containing different names for the ROI.
* Hide labeled objects from the training process.

For detailed information, see [Mapping ROI labels](../dataviews.md#mapping-roi-labels).

### Label Enumeration

Assign label enumeration in the **LABELS ENUMERATION** area.

### Iteration Control

The input data iteration control settings determine the order, number, timing, and reproducibility of the Dataview iterating 
SingleFrames. Depending upon the combination of iteration control settings, all SingleFrames may not be iterated, and some may repeat. 

For detailed information, see [Iteration control](../dataviews.md#iteration-control).
