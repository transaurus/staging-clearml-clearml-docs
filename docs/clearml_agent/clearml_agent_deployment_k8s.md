Agents can be deployed as Docker containers in a Kubernetes cluster. ClearML Agent adds missing scheduling capabilities to Kubernetes, enabling more flexible automation from code while leveraging all of ClearML Agent's features.

ClearML Agent is deployed onto a Kubernetes cluster using **Kubernetes-Glue**, which maps ClearML jobs directly to Kubernetes jobs. This allows seamless task execution and resource allocation across your cluster.

## How It Works
The ClearML Kubernetes-Glue performs the following:
- Pulls jobs from the ClearML execution queue.
- Prepares a Kubernetes job based on a provided YAML template.
- Inside each job pod, the `clearml-agent`:
  - Installs the required environment for the task.
  - Executes and monitors the task process.
  - Logs task data to the ClearML Server
   
## Deployment Options
You can deploy ClearML Agent onto Kubernetes using one of the following methods:

* **K8s Glue Script**:
  Run a [K8s Glue script](https://github.com/clearml/clearml-agent/blob/master/examples/k8s_glue_example.py) on a Kubernetes CPU node. This approach is less scalable and typically suited for simpler use cases.

* **ClearML Agent Helm Chart (Recommended)**:
  Use the ClearML Agent Helm Chart to spin up an agent pod acting as a controller. This is the recommended and 
  scalable approach. ClearML provides both [open-source](https://github.com/clearml/clearml-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/clearml-agent) 
  and [Enterprise](#agent-with-an-enterprise-server) Helm charts. See more details below. 


## ClearML Helm Chart
The ClearML Agent is installed on Kubernetes using a Helm chart. This sets up a controller pod that listens to ClearML queues and launches jobs as needed.

### Agent with an Open Source Server

1. Add the Helm Repository: 
  
   ```bash
   helm repo add clearml
   https://clearml.github.io/clearml-helm-charts
   ```

1. Update to latest version of this chart:
  
   ```bash
   helm repo update
   helm upgrade clearml-agent clearml/clearml-agent
   ```

1. Change values on existing installation:  
  
   ```bash
   helm upgrade clearml-agent clearml/clearml-agent --version <CURRENT CHART VERSION> -f custom_values.yaml
   ```

### Agent with an Enterprise Server

ClearML Enterprise adds advanced Kubernetes features, such as:
- **Multi-Queue Support**: Service multiple ClearML queues within the same Kubernetes cluster.
- **Pod-Specific Templates**: Define resource configurations per queue using pod templates.


#### Prerequisites

- A running [ClearML Enterprise Server](../deploying_clearml/enterprise_deploy/k8s.md)
- API credentials (`<ACCESS_KEY>` and `<SECRET_KEY>`) generated via 
  the ClearML UI (**Settings > Workspace > API Credentials > Create new credentials**). For more information, see [ClearML API Credentials](../webapp/settings/webapp_settings_profile.md#clearml-api-credentials). 

  :::note
  Make sure these credentials belong to an admin user or a service account with admin privileges.
  :::
 
- The worker environment must be able to access the ClearML Server over the same network.
- A DockerHub token to access the OCI enterprise Helm charts and Docker images
- To support **GPU** queues, you must deploy the **NVIDIA GPU Operator** on your Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [GPU Operator](fractional_gpus/gpu_operator.md).

#### Installation

1. Log into the ClearML OCI Registry:

   ```bash
   helm registry login docker.io --username allegroaienterprise --password <CLEARML_DOCKERHUB_TOKEN>
   ```

1. Create a `clearml-agent-values.override.yaml` file with the following content:

   :::note
   Replace the `<ACCESS_KEY>` and `<SECRET_KEY>` with the API credentials you generated earlier. 
   Set the `<api|file|web>ServerUrlReference` fields to match your ClearML 
   Server URLs.
   :::

   ```yaml
   imageCredentials:
     password: "<CLEARML_DOCKERHUB_TOKEN>"
   clearml:
     agentk8sglueKey: "<ACCESS_KEY>"
     agentk8sglueSecret: "<SECRET_KEY>"
   agentk8sglue:
     apiServerUrlReference: "<CLEARML_API_SERVER_REFERENCE>"
     fileServerUrlReference: "<CLEARML_FILE_SERVER_REFERENCE>"
     webServerUrlReference: "<CLEARML_WEB_SERVER_REFERENCE>"
     createQueues: true
     queues:
       exampleQueue:
         templateOverrides: {}
         queueSettings: {}
   ```

1. Install the ClearML Enterprise Agent Helm chart:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade -i -n <WORKER_NAMESPACE> clearml-enterprise-agent oci://docker.io/clearml/clearml-enterprise-agent --create-namespace -f clearml-agent-values.override.yaml
   ```

#### Workload Customization

The ClearML Agent monitors [ClearML queues](../fundamentals/agents_and_queues.md) for tasks that are scheduled for execution.

ClearML supports specifying custom definitions for individual queues for fine-grained control of workload parameters; you 
can set Kubernetes overrides such as pod resources and labels, as well as runtime definitions like environment variables, 
container images, or ClearML worker ID formats.

For more information, see [Custom Workload Configuration](clearml_agent_custom_workload.md). 

#### Agent Configuration for Orchestration Dashboard

ClearML Agents can be configured to report resource availability and control how workers appear in the [Orchestration Dashboard](../webapp/webapp_orchestration_dash.md).

For configuration details, see [Orchestration Dashboard Customization](clearml_agent_orch_dash_k8s.md).

#### Additional Configuration Options

To view available configuration options for the Helm chart, run the following command:

```bash
helm show readme oci://docker.io/clearml/clearml-enterprise-agent
# or
helm show values oci://docker.io/clearml/clearml-enterprise-agent
```
